# jekyll-octopod

Today, on November 9th 2020, after 1690 days  of maintainence, 204 commits and 59 releases, I stop working
on this project due to lack of time.

I would probably rather start a rewrite in dart than trying to fix what
I don't like about this project. Back in October 2020 I tried to collect
[my thoughts on the status](https://github.com/jekyll-octopod/jekyll-octopod/blob/master/ROADMAP.md)
and they are mostly still valid.

I case you want to step up as maintainer of this project, get in touch! (<stefan.haslinger@informatom.com>)
